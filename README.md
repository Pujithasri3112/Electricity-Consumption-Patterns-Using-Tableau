⚡ Electricity Consumption Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard built using Tableau to analyze electricity consumption patterns across Indian states and regions. The dashboard transforms raw consumption data into meaningful insights through maps, bar charts, trend analysis, and comparative visualizations. It enables users to explore yearly, quarterly, and regional variations, including the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on electricity usage.
